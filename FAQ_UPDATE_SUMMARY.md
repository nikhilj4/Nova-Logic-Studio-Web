# FAQ Update - Icons Removed 🚫

## ✅ Icons Removed

As requested, I've removed the decorative icons from the FAQ section.

### Changes Made
- **File**: `/src/components/FAQSection.tsx`
- **Action**: Removed `icon` property from all `faqData` items.
- **Result**: The questions now appear cleanly without any accompanying icons.

### Current Status
- **Question 1**: "What is the Nova Logic approach?" (Text only)
- **Question 2**: "How long does the transformation take?" (Text only)
- ...and so on.

The accordion functionality (expand/collapse) and the Plus/Minus indicators remain fully functional.
