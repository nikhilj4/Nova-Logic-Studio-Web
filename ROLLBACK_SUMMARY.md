# Rollback Complete - Animated Icons Removed

## ✅ Successfully Rolled Back

I've removed all the animated icon changes and restored your files to their previous working state.

### Files Restored:
1. **src/components/Hero.tsx** - Back to original (no floating icons)
2. **src/components/ui/feature-section-with-hover-effects.tsx** - Back to original (static icons)
3. **src/components/ui/animated-scroll-indicator.tsx** - Deleted (was newly created)

### What's Back to Normal:
- ✅ Hero section - Clean, no floating icons
- ✅ Why Choose Us - Static icons (no animations)
- ✅ No scroll indicator
- ✅ Original, stable design

### Current Status:

Your website at `http://localhost:3000` now has:
1. **Hero** - Original scroll hero with dashboard image
2. **Marquee** - Scrolling text
3. **Why Choose Us** - 8 feature cards with static icons
4. **Text Reveal** - Animated section
5. **Project Gallery** - All 14 screenshots (2 per row on mobile)
6. **Tools** - Tech stack
7. **Contact** - Contact form

Everything is back to the stable, working version before the animated icons were added! 🎉
