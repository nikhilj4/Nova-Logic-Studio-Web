# Reverted to Original Hero Section

## ✅ Changes Made

I've reverted the website back to your original working hero section.

### What Was Reverted:

1. **Hero Component** - Restored to original `ContainerScroll` version
2. **CSS Styles** - Removed all horizon hero styles
3. **Your Site is Back to Normal** - Everything working as before

### What's Still Available:

The 3D horizon hero component files are still in your project if you want to use them later:
- `/src/components/ui/horizon-hero-section.tsx`
- Dependencies: `three`, `gsap` are installed

### Why It Didn't Work:

The 3D hero component was conflicting with:
- Your existing navbar positioning
- Page layout structure  
- The 300vh height was creating layout issues

### Current Status:

✅ Your original hero is back and working
✅ Project gallery with screenshots - working
✅ Why Choose Us section - working
✅ Navigation - working
✅ All sections properly spaced

## Your Website is Now Stable! 🎉

All your previous work is intact:
- ✅ Project gallery with all 14 images (2 per row on mobile)
- ✅ Blue color scheme
- ✅ Smooth scroll navigation
- ✅ Reduced section gaps
- ✅ Why Choose Us (2 cards per row on mobile)
- ✅ Original working hero section

Everything is back to normal and working properly!
